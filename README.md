mappen OLA2SQ indeholder api projectet i en mappe kaldet 'OLA2SQ'. Derudover er der også en mappe kaldet OLA2SQ.Tests som indeholder unit tests.

I den anden mappe OLA2SQ_integrationtests indeholder alle intregration tests.

Reflection on Coverage and Performance
Ensuring Code Coverage

Unit Tests: I implemented unit tests to validate individual components of the application, particularly focusing on the business logic within the service layer and controller actions. By using xUnit, I ensured that each unit test was targeted and covered various scenarios, including edge cases. 

Integration Tests: In addition to unit tests, I incorporated integration tests to validate the interactions between various components of the application, such as the database context and the API endpoints. These tests helped confirm that the system as a whole functioned correctly, ensuring that the API responses matched expected outcomes when interacting with the database.

Importance of Code Coverage
Code coverage is an essential metric that provides insight into the effectiveness of testing efforts. It serves as a tool to ensure that the most critical parts of the code are tested, thus minimizing the risk of untested code leading to production errors. However, it’s crucial to understand that achieving high coverage is not an end in itself; it should complement the goal of building quality software.

In my project, maintaining high code coverage ensured that I could confidently deploy the API, knowing that the core functionalities were rigorously tested. However, I remained mindful that coverage should not come at the expense of test quality.

Optimizing Performance
The load testing results revealed performance bottlenecks that could be addressed to optimize the API's performance. Notably, the high number of ECONNRESET errors indicated that the server struggled to handle concurrent requests effectively.

Things that can be improved: 

Optimize Database Access: Review and optimize queries made by the API to reduce response times. 

Improve Server Configuration: Adjust server settings to allow for greater concurrency and enhance resource allocation, ensuring the server can handle increased load without errors.

Caching Strategies: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to minimize database calls and reduce load times, thus improving overall throughput.

Profiling and Monitoring: Utilize application performance monitoring tools to continuously analyze the API’s performance under various load conditions, allowing for ongoing optimizations.
